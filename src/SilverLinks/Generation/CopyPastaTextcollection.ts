export const BeeMovie = `According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

Hang on a second.
Hello?

You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!`;

export const NavySeal = `What the heck did you just say about me, you little troublemaker? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids, and I have over 300 confirmed missions. I am trained in advanced warfare and I'm the top marksman in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will defeat you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying that stuff over the Internet? Think again, friend. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of agents across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, buddy. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're done, kid.`;

export const AmongUs = `Red sus. Red suuuus. I said red, sus, hahahahaha. Why aren't you laughing? I just made a reference to the popular video game "Among Us"! How can you not laugh at it? Emergency meeting! Guys, this here guy doesn't laugh at my funny Among Us memes! Let's vote him out! Dead body reported! Skip! Skip! Vote blue! Blue was not an impostor. Among us in a nutshell hahahaha. What?! You're still not laughing? I made SEVERAL funny references to Among Us and YOU STILL AREN'T LAUGHING??!!! Bruh. Ya hear that? Woooooosh. That's the joke flying over your head. My humor is so advanced that only people with 200+ IQ can understand it.`;

export const ToBeOrNotToBe = `To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them. To die—to sleep, no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: for in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause.`;

export const FlyingLotus = `I saw Flying Lotus at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, "Oh, like you're doing now?" I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but he kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like "Sir, you need to pay for those first." At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.`;

export const GordonRamsay = `This code is RAW! Absolutely RAW! What are you, an idiot sandwich? You've got more bugs than a cheap motel! This function is so poorly written, it makes me want to throw my laptop out the window! WHERE'S THE ERROR HANDLING?! It's MISSING! This is a complete disaster! I've seen better code written by my grandmother, and she's been dead for 20 years! You muppet! This code is so bad, it makes me physically ill! GET OUT OF MY KITCHEN... I MEAN, GET OUT OF MY REPOSITORY!`;

export const ChuckNorris = `Chuck Norris doesn't code. He just stares at the screen until it does what he wants. When Chuck Norris writes code, the bugs fix themselves out of fear. Chuck Norris can divide by zero. Chuck Norris doesn't use version control because time moves backward when he makes a mistake. Chuck Norris can make a Hello World program in binary without a compiler. When Chuck Norris points at a broken server, it fixes itself. Chuck Norris counted to infinity. Twice. The dinosaurs looked at Chuck Norris the wrong way once. You know what happened to them.`;

export const ModernProblems = `Modern problems require modern solutions. Back in my day, we didn't have fancy frameworks and libraries. We wrote everything in assembly and we LIKED it! We walked uphill both ways to the computer lab, in the snow, barefoot! These kids today with their JavaScript and their "easy deployment" - they don't know how good they have it! We had to debug with print statements and we were GRATEFUL! Now they want "syntax highlighting" and "auto-complete" - luxury! In my day, a memory leak meant you had to restart your computer and lose 3 hours of work!`;
