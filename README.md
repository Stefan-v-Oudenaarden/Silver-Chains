Silver Chains
A powerful web-based text processing application that allows you to chain simple text operators for complex transformations. Built with TypeScript, Angular, and Ionic.

# Overview

Silver Chains is inspired by CyberChef and provides an intuitive interface for chaining text operations together. Whether you need to extract data, transform text formatting, apply ciphers, or analyze content, Silver Chains makes it easy to build complex processing pipelines from simple operators.

## Using Silver Chains Online

Simply visit [https://stefan-v-oudenaarden.github.io/Silver-Chains/](https://stefan-v-oudenaarden.github.io/Silver-Chains/) to start using the application immediately.

## How It Works

1. **Input your text** in the input area
2. **Add operators** to create your processing chain
3. **Configure each operator** with the desired parameters
4. **Watch the transformation** happen in real-time
5. **Copy or export** your processed results

### Search & Filter Operations

- Text searching and filtering
- Regular expression matching and replacement
- Pattern-based text extraction

### Data Extraction

- Email address extraction
- Number extraction
- Custom pattern extraction

### Encoding & Ciphers

- ROT13 cipher
- Base64 encoding/decoding
- MD5 hashing
- 1337 (leet speak) text conversion
- And more encoding options

### Text Case Transformations

- camelCase conversion
- snake_case conversion
- kebab-case conversion
- UPPERCASE/lowercase
- Title Case

### Text Manipulation

- Text reversal
- Line sorting (alphabetical, numerical)
- Text randomization
- Line number addition/removal

### Text Analysis

- Word counting
- Sentence counting
- Paragraph counting
- Character counting
- Word frequency analysis

And Much More
Silver Chains includes many additional text processing operators to handle various transformation needs.

## Use Cases

## Inspiration

Silver Chains is inspired by [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), the fantastic "Cyber Swiss Army Knife" tool. While CyberChef focuses primarily on cybersecurity and cryptographic operations, Silver Chains aims to provide a streamlined experience for general text processing and transformation tasks.
